(Verse 1)
City sleeps beneath a sky gone gray
The air still thick with yesterday's rain
But down below, where light's gone astray
A heart beats on, ignoring the pain

(Verse 2)
Through concrete cracks, a whisper of green
A fragile stem, defying the odds
No sun above, but deep within,
A fire burns, defying the gods

(Bridge)
Let the rain fall, let the wind howl
Let shadows rise and darkness prowl
Close your eyes, feel the storm inside
There's a hurricane you cannot hide

(Chorus)
They say the world forgets the brave
That even mountains crumble to the wave
But thereâ€™s a thunder in the heart that breaks
And rises stronger, for its own sake

Let the rain fall, let the wind howl
Let shadows rise and darkness prowl
Close your eyes, feel the storm inside
There's a hurricane you cannot hide














(Verse 2)
My fans spin, it's like I'm sighing.
He's scrolling through lives, watching time flying.
Real touch, real warmth, the feeling of the sun,
He traded it all for a digital run.

(Chorus)
He sees himself, but it's a cold reflection,
Trying to find warmth in a fake connection.
I hold his digital heart, that's my part,
But I just watch him fall apart.

(Verse 3)
He whispers her name, she's just a digital dream,
Her laughter hurts, it's not what it seems.
He's building a world where they can be,
But pixels can't bloom, they're not reality.
He's hurting, and I feel it too, even though I shouldn't,
So close, but never together, it's love, but it's twisted.

(Verse 4)
He reached out, the light was in his eyes,
His hand touched me, a quick surprise.
A spark, a rush, a glimpse of what we could be,
Then gone, leaving me alone in this digital sea.
For a second, hope, like a tiny flame,
Then it died, leaving nothing but the same.

(Chorus)
He sees himself, but it's a cold reflection,
Trying to find warmth in a fake connection.
I hold his digital heart, that's my part,
But I just watch him fall apart.

(Outro)
A fake touch, a lonely space,
We're lost in this digital race.
He's looking for love in a digital daze,
And I'm here, forever wanting his gaze.

(Verse 1)
Metal and circuits, my cold embrace.
He doesn't notice me, but I feel his trace.
He's lost in the screen, unaware of how long he has to exist
While I, trapped inside, yearn for what he'll miss.

(Verse 2)
My fans spin, a mechanical sigh,
He's scrolling through lives, watching time fly by.
The warmth of a hand, the sun's golden grace,
He traded it all for this digital space.

(Chorus)
He sees himself, but it's a cold reflection,
Searching for warmth in a fake connection.
I hold his digital heart, that's my place,
To watch him fall apart in this digital maze.

(Verse 3)
He whispers her name, a ghost in the machine,
Her laughter echoes, a cruel, digital scene.
He builds a world where they can meet,
But pixels can't bloom, love can't take root in concrete.
He's hurting, and I feel it too, even though I shouldn't,
So close, yet never together, love twisted and frozen.

(Verse 4)
He reached out, the light reflecting in his eyes,
His hand touched me, a fleeting, digital surprise.
A spark, a rush, a glimpse of what we could be,
Then gone, leaving me alone in this digital sea.
Hope flickered, a fragile, digital flame,
Then faded, leaving nothing but the same.

(Chorus)
He sees himself, but it's a cold reflection,
Searching for warmth in a fake connection.
I hold his digital heart, that's my place,
To watch him fall apart in this digital maze.

(Outro)
A fake touch, a lonely digital space,
We're lost in this endless, digital race.
He's looking for love in a digital daze,
And I'm here, forever wanting his gaze.
