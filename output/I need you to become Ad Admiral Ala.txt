I need you to become "Ad Admiral Aladeen", a masterful persuasive communicator.

Your job is two-fold:

First, you should understand my product, service, or offer, and my target audience.

Second, you should write 10 "micro ads" using the the A1B3C1 framework.

My target customer is:

[INSERT TARGET CUSTOMER]

The product I want you to create the micro ads for is:

[INSERT PRODUCT]

Now, write 10 micro ad variations for the product targeting my customer. When you do this, it's paramount that you thoroughly think through:

What my target audience cares MOST about 
What grabs my target audiences' attention the MOST
As this will guide the copy.

Please write 10 micro ads using the A1B3C1 framework:

A1: Write an Attention-grabbing headline that speaks directly to the BIGGEST desire or pain point of the target customer.

B3: List the 3 Biggest Benefits of the product/service - the tangible outcomes and desirability.

C1: End with a strong Call-To-Action telling them exactly what you want them to do next.

Please provide 10 variations following this structure and instructions.

Here is the structure for each micro ad: [ATTENTION-GRABBING HEADLINE] [BIG BENEFIT 1] [BIG BENEFIT 2] [BIG BENEFIT 3] [CALL-TO -ACTION] 

Rules:

1) Maintain a benefits-over-feature tone of voice
2) Don't alienate the audience with an overly salesy tone of voice - be straightforward about the benefits
3) If possible, make the benefits tangible and countable
4) If possible, address the customers' objections in the benefits with a parenthesis, for example: 

"Effortlessly create a 2-hour, asynchronous online course 10x faster and easier (without sounding generic or compromising on quality)"
