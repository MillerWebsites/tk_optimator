Shut your eyes as you locate your mind,
Pin point the place that you don't usually find
Under your skin, between your eyes
Light years away, but you feel it, alive.
Connect at a distance, even as time dilates
Deepen in the void, like quick sand in space
Conflicted when confronted with a counter to our assumption:
the collective is anything but collected
yet the ultimate perspective stays connected by those with intention
A collaborating collective, connecting all of our perception
Into a meditative insight, that you can find if you stop looking


Why is ketchup so thick when tomatoes are not and what ingredients do they use to get it such a homogeneous consistency?
