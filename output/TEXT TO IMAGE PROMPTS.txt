Depict an abstract, stylized oil painting of a rose. The artwork is vibrant and uses a multicolored palette, with thick, bold outlines defining each petal. The petals are filled with flat colors in various shades, including blue, green, yellow, red, purple, and orange. They are arranged in a spiraling geometric pattern that leads towards the center of the rose, creating a sense of depth and complexity. The background is solid black, which sharply contrasts with the bright colors of the rose, making the subject stand out prominently. The painting style is modern, with a clear influence of cubism, as evidenced by the deconstructed shapes that form the petals, representing them as a series of planes and facets.
