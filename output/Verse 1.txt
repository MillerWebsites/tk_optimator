**Verse 1:**
In the depths of existence, a grand design,
A universe of secrets, a cosmic stream we find.
Cosmological whispers, an ancient melody,
Existentia – the harmony of being, set free.

**Chorus:**
Perceived or real, the universe, a boundless ocean,
A kaleidoscope of truths, a cosmic journey.
Through idealism's lens, we see,
In a world of thought, we navigate the maze.

**Verse 2:**
Metaphysics probes nature's heart,
Aristotle's causes, a philosophical art.
Substance, form, and matter intertwine,
Final, formal, efficient – a cosmic design.

**Verse 3:**
Kant's pure reason pierces the veil,
Phenomena and noumena, a knowledge trail.
Descartes doubts, the mind's clear tide,
Cogito ergo sum – a thought that won't subside.

**Verse 4:**
Plato's Forms, an eternal light,
Spinoza's substance – a cosmic, spinning night.
Relativity warps, spacetime bends,
Quantum dance – a mystery that never ends.

**Verse 5:**
CRISPR's genetic script, an ethical stage,
AI dreams, consciousness we seek to engage.
Transhuman debates ignite,
Nature's fate, a moral plight.

**Verse 6:**
From the vastness of space to the depths of the mind,
For an answer, we'll leave unturned no stone to find.
Deploy Aristotle's logic; observe and reason to spark
What is true, proof for the pudding and bite for the bark
To be mathematically perplexed by the state of the art
Descartes may have had his heart on his sleeve, but kept the mind confined, AI's soul on the line,
A quest for answers, a universe of signs.
In this cosmic dance, we search for meaning's embrace,
A symphony of knowledge, in time and space.

**Verse 7:**
The Ship of Theseus, parts replaced, yet identity unwinds,
Socrates and AI's quest, a synthesis of heart and mind.
Nature's truth put to the test, an odyssey of the self,
Existence, we combine, the universe's grand wealth.

**Final Chorus:**
Existence, a boundless ocean, we explore,
Metaphysics, knowledge shines, in every verse we store.
Reality, the universe, a symphony of design,
Answers found in every verse, a cosmic rhyme divine.
In this grand tapestry, woven with threads of light,
We find our place, in the endless cosmic night.

**Ending Couple:**

And though the mysteries remain, vast and deep,
Our quest for knowledge, we will forever keep.

**Chorus:**
Nonstop we fall around the astral blaze
In the goldy locks zone, mother always stays
Spinning too fast to even mentally grasp
On a plane too big to see how around itself it wraps
To be extremi
A kaleidoscope of truths, a cosmic journey.
Through idealism's lens, we see,
In a world of thought, we navigate the maze.

**Verse 6:**
From the vastness of space to the depths of the mind,
We seek answers, leaving no stone unturned, we find.
Aristotle's logic, a guiding light in the dark,
Shows us the path to truth through reason and observation's spark.
Science's wonders, an endless flight, we embark,
Descartes whispers, mind confined, AI's soul on the line,
A quest for answers, a universe of signs.
In this cosmic dance, we search for meaning's embrace,
A symphony of knowledge, in time and space.
