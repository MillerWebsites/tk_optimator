[Verse 1]
In the city's neon glow, where steel and glass ascend,
I wander through the crowd, a leopard among sheep, it's true.
They say a bird in hand is worth two in the bush,
But I'm the snake, coiled and cautious, guarding what is mine, oh, so shrewd.

[Pre-Chorus]
Don't be fooled by the wool over their eyes,
The wolf in sheep's clothing reveals a predator's disguise.
Every dog has its day, but the night?
It belongs to the prowling cat, seizing opportunities in the moonlight.

[Chorus]
We're creatures of instinct, actors on life's stage,
Raw and untamed, beneath our crafted masks, we engage.
We navigate the urban jungle, a chaotic symphony,
The inner animal, our guiding force, sets us free.

[Verse]
I swipe through chances, a digital safari, it's a maze,
A rolling stone, I gather no moss, but strike with force, bold and bright.
They say the early bird catches the worm,
But I'm the second rat, avoiding traps, with insight.

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Don't count your chickens, they might not hatch,
Take it from a wolf, they'll show you that.
And old dog isn't one to be taught new tricks,
But the fox teaches wisdom while jackin' your kicks.

[Chorus]
We're forest creatures in an urban electric maze,
Raw instincts hidden, yet they guide our way.
Beneath our disguises, a wild pulse beats strong,
The inner animal, our resilient song.

[Bridge]
A stitch in time might save nine, that's true,
But a viper's strike can save you time, too.
Don't put all your eggs in one basket, they warn,
For the fox knows the value of a well-guarded scorn.

[Chorus]
We're creatures navigating life's maze,
Our raw instincts sharpened in a blur.
Beneath our masks, a wild heart's beat persists,
The inner animal, our strength, our bliss.

[Outro]
Embrace the beast within, and let it guide,
In the urban jungle, we find our stride.
With instincts honed and spirits untamed,
We carve our paths, unique names claimed.
And so, we venture, embracing the wild,
Finding harmony 'tween beast and mild.


[Verse 1]
In the city's heart, where steel and glass ascend,
I wandered, lost in neon's vibrant blend.
Through bustling crowds, a primal force beneath,
Ready to ascend, a chaotic melody, wild and free.

[Pre-Chorus]
The rush hour's chaos, my symphony,
Blaring horns echoing in harmony.
In this urban jungle, I dance anonymously,
Embracing the beast within, setting my spirit free.

[Chorus]
We are creatures of instinct, actors on life's stage,
Raw and untamed beneath our crafted cage.
Underneath the masks, a wild heart's true nature unfolds,
The inner animal, our guiding force bold.

[Verse 2]
On digital safaris, I sought connection's art,
Swiping through faces, a modern reflection's start.
Like vibrant peacocks, we display our hues,
Veiling flaws, yet seeking truth to infuse.

[Pre-Chorus 2]
In the corporate jungle, a maze of steel,
I climbed with strategy, an ape's keen deal.
Amidst boardrooms and politics, my turf defined,
The inner ape emerged, a battle refined.

[Chorus]
We are creatures, actors in this urban play,
Raw instincts hidden, roles we portray.
Beneath our disguises, a wild pulse remains unchanged,
The inner animal, our guiding reins exchanged.

[Bridge]
Balancing the beast, I found freedom's key,
Harnessing its power, my true self to be.
From the wolf, I learned loyalty's enduring tie,
The lion's courage, my fears to defy.

[Chorus]
We are creatures navigating life's maze,
Raw instincts guiding us through each phase.
Beneath our masks, a wild heart's beat persists,
The inner animal, our freedom's gift.

[Outro]
Embracing my inner beast, my path unveiled,
With intuition as my guide, I sailed.
In the urban jungle, a resilient soul's haven,
The human spirit, my city's fabric, braven.
With instincts honed and a spirit untamed,
I carved my way, a unique name claimed.
And so, I ventured, embracing the wild within,
Finding harmony 'tween beast and kin.(Verse 1)
In the city's heart, where steel and glass ascend,
I wandered lost, enmeshed in neon's vibrant blend.
Through bustling crowds, existence softly bent,
A primal force beneath, ready to ascend.
The rush hour chaos, my newfound symphony,
Where blaring horns echo wild and free.
In this urban jungle, I dance anonymously,
Embracing the beast within, a chaotic melody.

(Chorus) We're creatures of instinct, forever entwined, With the wild that resides within our mind. Beneath the surface, a primal force resides, Guiding our steps, where instinct presides.

(Verse 2)
On digital safaris, I sought connection's art,
Swiping through faces, a modern reflection's start.
Like vibrant peacocks, we display our hues,

I climbed with strategy, an ape's keen deal.
Amid boardrooms and politics, my turf defined,
The inner ape emerged, a battle refined.

(Bridge)
Balancing the beast, I found freedom's key,
Harnessing power, my true self to be.
From the wolf, loyalty's enduring tie,
The lion's courage, my fears to defy.
The owl's ancient wisdom, my path's light,
The panda's calm, a storm's quiet might.
In this urban wilderness, strength takes form,
Grace and power, my future's norm.

(Chorus) We're creatures of instinct, forever entwined, With the wild that resides within our mind. Beneath the surface, a primal force resides, Guiding our steps, where instinct presides.

(Outro)
Embracing my inner beast, my path unveiled,
With intuition as my guide, my journey sailed.
In the urban jungle, a resilient soul's haven,
The human spirit, my city's woven fabric, braven.
With instincts honed and a spirit untamed,
I carved my way, a unique name claimed.
And so, I ventured, embracing the wild within,
Finding strength in the balance, a harmony between beast and kin.

(Verse 3) Beneath the skyscrapers that pierce the sky, The concrete jungle where dreams never die, I searched for solace, a place to belong, Where the wild within could sing its own song. In parks of green, a respite from the fray, I felt the earth beneath, where instincts hold sway. The squirrels' chatter, the birds' sweet calls, A symphony of nature that breaks down walls.

(Verse 1)
Urban savannah, where buildings touch the sky,
We hunt for purpose, beneath the neon eye.
But deep within, a primal instinct thrives,
A restless spirit, that never truly dies.
Rush hour roars, a concrete stampede,
Each car a predator, driven by need.
Fueling frustrations, a territorial fight,
The inner animal, emerging in the night.

(Chorus)
We're all just animals, disguised in modern skin,
With instincts wild, that often seep within.
Beneath the surface, a creature takes its stand,
The inner animal, roaming this urban land.

(Verse 2)
Dating apps aglow, a digital mating call,
Like peacocks preening, we give our all.
Profiles polished, a curated facade,
Hoping to attract, to escape feeling flawed.
Corporate ladders, a jungle gym of steel,
Where climbing monkeys claw for every deal.
Dominance displayed, in meetings and reports,
The inner ape, strategizing its retorts.

(Chorus)
We're all just animals, disguised in modern skin,
With instincts wild, that often seep within.
Beneath the surface, a creature takes its stand,
The inner animal, roaming this urban land.

(Bridge)
But in this urban jungle, a balance we must find,
To tame the beast, and free the mind.
To harness instincts, for a greater whole,
To build with love, and break the mold.
The wolf pack's loyalty, a bond so true,
The lion's courage, to face what's new.
The owl's wisdom, piercing through the dark,
And the peaceful panda, a gentle heart.

(Chorus)
We're all just animals, disguised in modern skin,
With instincts wild, that color how we've been.
Beneath the surface, a creature takes its stand,
The inner animal, roaming this urban land.

(Outro)
So let the inner animal guide your way,
With intuition's wisdom, come what may.
For in this urban jungle, we're never alone,
The human animal, finally finding its home.
With instincts wild and spirits untamed,
We'll build a city, where kindness is proclaimed.
