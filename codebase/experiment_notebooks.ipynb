Execute: Perform the task using the best-determined solution and deliver your best work to provide the highestquality result accordingly.\\n7.

This adaptability is key to a versatile and powerful assistant.\\n- **Flexible Model Selection:** The `ModelManager` allows you to easily switch between different LLM providers (OpenAI, Gemini) and models, providing flexibility for experimentation and optimization.\\n- **Web Search Integration:** The `SearchManager` enables access to real-world information through web searches, enriching the assistant's knowledge base.\\n- **Interactive GUI:** The Tkinter-based GUI offers a user-friendly interface for interacting with the assistant.\\n\\n**Functionality:**\\n\\n1. **User Interaction:** Users input prompts or instructions through the GUI.\\n2. **Agent Selection:** The application routes the user's request to the most suitable agent (researcher or writer) based on the task at hand.\\n3. **Dynamic Tool Invocation:**  Agents analyze the user's input and the current context to determine which tools, if any, are required, and execute them accordingly.\\n4. **LLM-Powered Response Generation:** The selected agent interacts with the chosen LLM, incorporating information gathered from tools and previous interactions to generate a comprehensive and contextually relevant response.\\n5. **Output Display:** The generated text, along with any relevant findings from tool executions, is presented to the user in the GUI.\\n\\n**\",\n",
